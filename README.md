# PacMan

## Description
> There are two buttons on the page, "Add PacMan" and "Start Game".<br>
> Everytime we press the "Add PaceMan", a new pacman will be created. <br>
> Everytime we press the "Start Game", all pacmen previously created will move from left to right within the window.<br>

## Roadmap for Improvement
> Make the pacmen open and close the mouth while it's moving.<br>
> Chage the pacman picture with the one with opposite direction whenever it hits the wall.<br>
